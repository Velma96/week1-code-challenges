## Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator

## Challenge 2: Speed Detector

Problem Statement

Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input (e.g., 80). If the speed is less than 70, the program should print "Ok". Otherwise:

For every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), the program should issue 1 demerit point.

If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print "License suspended".


Example
```bash
Input:

console.log(checkSpeed(80));

Output:

Points: 2

Input:

console.log(checkSpeed(135));

Output:

License suspended
```
